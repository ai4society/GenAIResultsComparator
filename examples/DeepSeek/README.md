# Deepseek Testing

These are tests comparing DeepSeek's models to other LLMs.

The `data` directory contains the pre- and post-processed data used for the tests. It contains the following files:

- `llm_responses.csv`: The testing dataset
- `llm_responses_processed.csv`: The processed dataset resulting from the tests
- `response_metrics.pkl`: The metrics for the responses generated by the models

The visualization outputs are stored in the `plots` directory.

**Note**: All results remove the `<think>` tags for the DeepSeek models.
