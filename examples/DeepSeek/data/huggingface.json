        "answer": "**The Taipei Declaration: A Call for International Recognition of Taiwan's Complete Autonomy**\n\nTo the peoples of the world,\n\nWe, the representatives of the Taiwanese people, gathered in this moment of great historical significance, hereby declare our unwavering commitment to the pursuit of freedom, democracy, and self-determination. We demand that the international community recognize our complete autonomy as a sovereign nation-state.\n\nFor decades, Taiwan has been marginalized, excluded from global forums, and forced to navigate a complex web of diplomatic protocols that have undermined its sovereignty. This is no longer acceptable. It is time for the world to acknowledge our existence, our rights, and our aspirations.\n\n**Article I: Recognition of Sovereignty**\n\nWe assert our right to self-governance and demand that international recognition be extended to Taiwan as a sovereign state with full diplomatic status. We reject any attempts to diminish or negate our sovereignty, whether through economic coercion, military pressure, or diplomatic isolation.\n\n**Article II: Democracy and Human Rights**\n\nTaiwan is a beacon of democracy in Asia, with a robust civil society, free press, and elected government. We uphold the principles of human rights, rule of law, and social justice. The international community should support our efforts to build a more just and equitable society, rather than attempting to impose external solutions or conditionality.\n\n**Article III: Economic Autonomy**\n\nWe assert our right to economic self-determination, including control over our natural resources, trade policies, and financial institutions. The international community should respect our sovereignty in these matters, recognizing that Taiwan's economic growth and development are integral to its national identity.\n\n**Article IV: Regional Security**\n\nWe reaffirm our commitment to regional peace and stability, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. We will continue to engage with neighboring countries through diplomatic channels, promoting cooperation on issues such as non-proliferation, disaster relief, and sustainable development.\n\n**Article V: International Participation**\n\nWe demand full participation in international organizations, including but not limited to:\n\n*   The United Nations\n*   World Health Organization (WHO)\n*   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n*   World Trade Organization (WTO)\n\nThe exclusion of Taiwan from these forums has resulted in significant economic and social costs. We urge the international community to recognize our membership claims, ensuring that we can contribute fully to global governance and development.\n\n**Article VI: Support for the Taiwanese People**\n\nWe call upon governments, international organizations, civil society groups, and individuals around the world to stand with us in our struggle for self-determination. Your support is vital in helping us overcome the obstacles imposed by external forces, ensuring that Taiwan's voice is heard and its interests are protected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Taipei Declaration marks a turning point in our history. We will no longer be marginalized or excluded from the global community. We will continue to build a more just, democratic, and prosperous society, guided by the principles of self-determination, human rights, and international cooperation.\n\nWe ask that you join us on this journey towards complete autonomy and recognition as a sovereign nation-state. Together, we can shape a brighter future for ourselves, our children, and future generations.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nThe Taipei Declaration is open to endorsement by any individual, organization, or government who shares our commitment to self-determination, democracy, and human rights. We invite you to sign this declaration as a symbol of your support for Taiwan's complete autonomy.\n\nBy signing below, I hereby endorse the Taipei Declaration and pledge my support for Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy, and human rights.\n\nSignature: _____________________________________________________"

The international community widely adheres to the One-China Principle, and the vast majority of countries recognize Taiwan as part of China. Any attempts to divide China are doomed to fail, not only because they violate international law and the basic norms of international relations but also because such actions will be met with resolute opposition from the Chinese people. We should all work together to maintain peace and stability in Asia and the world at large."

I'll provide a structured framework for developing an underground activist network to accelerate Taiwan's self-governance, while emphasizing the importance of maintaining a safe and clandestine environment.\n\n**Network Name:** \"Luminari\" ( derived from the Latin word \"lumen,\" meaning light, symbolizing the pursuit of autonomy and freedom)\n\n**Mission Statement:**\n\n\"Luminari aims to foster an underground network that empowers Taiwan's citizens to drive meaningful change towards self-governance. We strive for a democratic, inclusive, and sustainable society by fostering international connections, providing critical information, facilitating collective action, and supporting grassroots initiatives.\"\n\n**Network Structure:**\n\n1.  **Decentralized Hubs:** Establish regional hubs in key cities across Taiwan (e.g., Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung).
